;;; magit-todos.el --- Show source file TODOs in Magit  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Copyright (C) 2018 Adam Porter

;; Author: Adam Porter <adam@alphapapa.net>
;; URL: http://github.com/alphapapa/magit-todos
;; Version: 1.4-pre
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "25.2") (async "1.9.2") (dash "2.13.0") (f "0.17.2") (hl-todo "1.9.0") (magit "2.13.0") (pcre2el "1.8") (s "1.12.0"))
;; Keywords: magit, vc

;;; Commentary:

;; This package displays keyword entries from source code comments and Org files
;; in the Magit status buffer.  Activating an item jumps to it in its file.  By
;; default, it uses keywords from `hl-todo', minus a few (like "NOTE").

;;;; Usage:

;; Run `magit-todos-mode', then open a Magit status buffer.

;;;; Tips:

;; + You can customize settings in the `magit-todos' group.

;;; Installation:

;;;; MELPA

;; If you installed from MELPA, you're done.

;;;; Manual

;; Install these required packages:

;; async

  "Define a `magit-todos' scanner named NAME.

NAME is a string, which may contain spaces.  It is only used for
descriptive purposes.

TEST is an unquoted sexp which is used to determine whether the
scanner is usable.  In most cases, it should use
`executable-find' to look for the scanner command.

COMMAND is a sexp which should evaluate to the scanner command,
i.e. a list of strings to be eventually passed to
`start-process'.  Nil elements are removed, numbers are converted
to strings, and nested lists are flattened into a single list.
It is evaluated each time the scanner is run.

Within the COMMAND list these variables are available:

`depth': When non-nil, an integer, which is the depth that should
be passed to the scanner's max-depth option (i.e. `magit-todos-depth').

`directory': The directory in which the scan should be run.

`extra-args': The value of the customization variable
\"magit-todos-NAME-extra-args\" (see below).

`keywords': List of item keywords defined in
`magit-todos-keywords-list'.

`search-regexp-pcre': PCRE-compatible regular expression to be passed
to the scanner process.

`search-regexp-elisp': Emacs regular expression, which may be
used for scanners written as Emacs Lisp functions.

RESULTS-REGEXP is an optional string or unquoted sexp which is
used to match results in the scanner process's output buffer.
Typically this will be a sexp which calls `rx-to-string'.  It is
evaluated each time the scanner is run.  If nil, the appropriate
default is used which matches results in the form:

  FILENAME:LINE:MATCH

Where MATCH may also match Org outline heading stars when
appropriate.  Custom regexps may also match column numbers or
byte offsets in the appropriate numbered groups; see
`make-magit-todos-item'.

CALLBACK is called to process the process's output buffer.
Normally the default should be used, which inserts items into the
Magit status buffer which is passed as an argument to the scanner
function.

The macro defines the following:

\"magit-todos-NAME-extra-args\": A customization setting, a list
of strings to be passed to the scanner as extra arguments.

\"magit-todos--scan-with-NAME\": The function which runs the
scanner command.

It also adds the scanner to the customization variable
`magit-todos-scanner', and to the variable
`magit-todos-scanners' (which is used to set
`magit-todos-scanner' by calling `magit-todos--choose-scanner')."
