This package displays keyword entries from source code comments and Org files in the Magit status buffer.  Activating an item jumps to it in its file.  By default, it uses keywords from [[https://github.com/tarsius/hl-todo][hl-todo]], minus a few (like =NOTE=).

** Screenshots

Org headings can optionally be fontified as such (this shows sorting by filename, then keyword, then buffer position):

Sorting can be customized.  This shows sorting by keyword, then filename, then buffer position:

** Installation
:PROPERTIES:
:TOC:      0

If you installed from MELPA, you're done!

*** Manual

Install these required packages:

-  =a=
-  =anaphora=
-  =dash=
-  =f=
-  =hl-todo=
-  =magit=
-  =pcre2el=

Then put this file in your =load-path=, and put this in your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (require 'magit-todos)
#+END_SRC

** Usage

Run =magit-todos-mode=, then open a Magit status buffer.

** Tips

You can customize settings in the =magit-todos= group.

For example, in the Org repo, there are false positives for =next= in the =testing= directory's test files.  You could use ~add-dir-local-variable~ to set ~magit-todos-ignore-directories~ to ~"testing"~, and none of the files in that directory would be scanned for items.

** Credits

+  This package was inspired by [[https://github.com/danielma/magit-org-todos.el][magit-org-todos]].
+  The =ag= support was made much simpler by the great [[https://github.com/joddie/pcre2el][pcre2el]] package by Jon Oddie.
