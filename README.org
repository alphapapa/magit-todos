This package displays keyword entries from source code comments and Org files in the Magit status buffer.  Activating an item jumps to it in its file.  By default, it uses keywords from [[https://github.com/tarsius/hl-todo][hl-todo]], minus a few (like =NOTE=).

** Screenshots

Org headings can optionally be fontified as such, and sorting can be customized (this shows sorting by filename, then keyword, then buffer position):

Items can also be automatically grouped in a customizable way, which can be helpful in large repos:

This shows grouping items by the first path component, then keyword, then filename, and with optional keyword header fontification:

If you installed from MELPA, you're done!

*** Manual

Install these required packages:

-  =a=
-  =anaphora=
-  =async=
-  =dash=
-  =f=
-  =hl-todo=
-  =magit=
-  =pcre2el=
-  =s=

Then put this file in your =load-path=, and put this in your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (require 'magit-todos)
#+END_SRC

** Usage

Run =magit-todos-mode=, then open a Magit status buffer.

** Tips

+  Customize settings in the =magit-todos= group.
+  Jump to the to-do list in a Magit status buffer by pressing @@html:<kbd>@@j T@@html:</kbd>@@.  If the section is empty (e.g. when using manual updates), it will scan for items.
+  When configured for manual updates, manually update the to-do list by pressing @@html:<kbd>@@j T@@html:</kbd>@@ with point in the to-do list, or with the =magit-todos-update= command.
+  With point on a to-do item:
     -  Show the item by pressing @@html:<kbd>@@RET@@html:</kbd>@@
     -  Peek at the item by pressing @@html:<kbd>@@SPC@@html:</kbd>@@

** Credits

+  This package was inspired by [[https://github.com/danielma/magit-org-todos.el][magit-org-todos]].
+  The =ag= support was made much simpler by the great [[https://github.com/joddie/pcre2el][pcre2el]] package by Jon Oddie.
