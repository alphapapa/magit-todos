This package displays keyword entries from source code comments and Org files in the Magit status buffer.  Activating an item jumps to it in its file.  By default, it uses keywords from [[https://github.com/tarsius/hl-todo][hl-todo]], minus a few (like =NOTE=).

** Screenshots

Org headings can optionally be fontified as such, and sorting can be customized (this shows sorting by filename, then keyword, then buffer position):

Items can also be automatically grouped in a customizable way, which can be helpful in large repos:

This shows grouping items by the first path component, then keyword, then filename, and with optional keyword header fontification:
