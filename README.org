  [[https://melpa.org/#/magit-todos][file:https://melpa.org/packages/magit-todos-badge.svg]] [[https://stable.melpa.org/#/magit-todos][file:https://stable.melpa.org/packages/magit-todos-badge.svg]]

This package displays keyword entries from source code comments and Org files in the Magit status buffer.  Activating an item jumps to it in its file.  By default, it uses keywords from [[https://github.com/tarsius/hl-todo][hl-todo]], minus a few (like =NOTE=).

** Screenshots

[[screenshots/matrix.png]]

Items from Org files can be displayed, and can be fontified like in Org buffers:

[[screenshots/fancy-org.png]]

Items can also be automatically grouped in a customizable way, which can be helpful in large repos:

[[screenshots/emacs-grouped.png]]

This shows grouping items by the first path component, then keyword, then filename, and with optional keyword header fontification:

Items in =KEYWORD(username):= format are also read:

** Installation

*** External scanner

One of the following external scanners is required:

+  [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][ripgrep]]
+  =git grep= (built with PCRE support)
+  GNU =grep= (built with PCRE support)

Most Linux systems should have the latter two by default, but some non-standard systems may not.  For example, on MacOS you may use [[https://brew.sh/][Homebrew]] to install =ripgrep=, or =git= with PCRE support, like: ~brew reinstall --with-pcre2 git~.

*** Emacs package

If you installed from MELPA, you're done!

**** Manually

Install these required packages:

-  =async=
-  =dash=
-  =f=
-  =hl-todo=
-  =magit=
-  =pcre2el=
-  =s=

Then put this file in your =load-path=, and put this in your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (require 'magit-todos)
#+END_SRC

** Usage
:PROPERTIES:
:TOC:      0
:END:

Activate =magit-todos-mode=.  Then open a Magit status buffer, or run ~magit-todos-list~ to show a dedicated to-do list buffer.

*** Key bindings

*In Magit status buffer:*
+  @@html:<kbd>@@j T@@html:</kbd>@@ :: Jump to the to-do list.  If the section is empty (e.g. when using manual updates), it will scan for items.

*With point in to-do list:*
+  @@html:<kbd>@@j T@@html:</kbd>@@ :: When configured for manual updates, manually update the to-do list.
+  @@html:<kbd>@@j l@@html:</kbd>@@ :: Open dedicated to-do list buffer.
+  @@html:<kbd>@@RET@@html:</kbd>@@ :: Show item at point, or open dedicated buffer if point is on top heading.
+  @@html:<kbd>@@SPC@@html:</kbd>@@ :: Peek at the item at point.

*** Tips

+  Customize settings in the =magit-todos= group.
+  Use dir-local variables to set per-repository settings.  For example, to exclude files and directories from being scanned for to-dos in a repo:
     1.  From a buffer in the repo's directory (like a ~magit-status~ buffer), run the command ~add-dir-local-variable~.
     2.  Choose the mode ~magit-status-mode~.
     3.  Choose the variable ~magit-todos-exclude-globs~.
     4.  Input the glob value, like ~("*.html")~ to exclude HTML files.  (Note that the input is read as a lisp value, and this variable must be a list of strings.)
     5.  Now Emacs will remember that setting in that repository.  (You may also want to commit the =.dir-locals.el= file to the repo.)
+  The ~magit-todos-list~ command also works outside of git repos.

*** 1.3-pre

Nothing new yet.

*** 1.2

*Added*
+  Allow ~magit-todos-list~ to work outside git repos.
+  Option ~magit-todos-keyword-suffix~ replaces ~magit-todos-require-colon~, allowing for common and custom suffixes after item keywords (e.g. to match items like =TODO(user):=).  (Fixes [[https://github.com/alphapapa/magit-todos/issues/56][#56]].  Thanks to [[https://github.com/thiderman][Lowe Thiderman]] for suggesting.)
+  Optionally group and sort by item suffixes (e.g. handy when suffixes contain usernames).
+  Bind @@html:<kbd>@@RET@@html:</kbd>@@ on top-level =TODOs= section heading to ~magit-todos-list~ command.

*Fixed*
+  Don't fontify section item counts.  (Thanks to [[https://github.com/m-cat][Marcin Swieczkowski]].)

*Worked Around*
+  Issue in =async= regarding deleted buffers/processes.  This is not an ideal solution, but it solves the problem for now.

*Removed*
+ Option ~magit-todos-require-colon~, replaced by ~magit-todos-keyword-suffix~.

*** 1.1.8

*Fixed*
+  Properly unbind key when mode is disabled. ([[https://github.com/alphapapa/magit-todos/pull/74][#74]].  Thanks to [[https://github.com/akirak][Akira Komamura]].)
+  Don't show message when key is already bound correctly.  ([[https://github.com/alphapapa/magit-todos/pull/75][#75]].  Thanks to [[https://github.com/akirak][Akira Komamura]].)

*** 1.1.7

*Fixed*
+  Disable undo in hidden Org fontification buffer.
+  Expand top-level to-do list in ~magit-todos-list~ buffer.

*** 1.1.6

*Fixed*
+  Insert root section in ~magit-todos-list~ command.  (Really fixes [[https://github.com/alphapapa/magit-todos/issues/55][#55]].  Thanks to [[https://github.com/tarsius][Jonas Bernoulli]].)

*** 1.1.5

*Fixed*
+  Hide process buffers.  (Thanks to [[https://github.com/purcell][Steve Purcell]].)

*** 1.1.4

*Fixes*
+  ~magit-todos-depth~ number-to-string conversion.

*** 1.1.3

*Fixes*
+  Update ~magit-todos-list~ for Magit [[https://github.com/magit/magit/commit/40616d7ba57b7c491513e4130d82371460f9e94d][change]].  (Fixes [[https://github.com/alphapapa/magit-todos/issues/55][#55]].  Thanks to [[https://github.com/Oghma][Matteo Lisotto]].)

*** 1.1.2

*Fixes*
+  Convert ~magit-todos-depth~ setting appropriately for =rg= scanner.

*** 1.1.1

*Fixes*
+  Ensure mode is activated in ~magit-todos-update~ command.  (Fixes #54.  Thanks to [[https://github.com/smaret][Sebastien Maret]].)

*** 1.1

*Additions*
+  Dedicated to-do list buffer.
+  Option ~magit-todos-exclude-globs~, a list of glob patterns to ignore when searching for to-do items.
+  Kill running scans when Magit status buffer is closed.

*Changes*
+  Remove dependency on ~a~.

+  Define variables earlier to avoid compiler warnings.
+  Remove unused var ~magit-todos-ignore-file-suffixes~.

*** 1.0.2

*Fixes*
+  ~regexp-quote~ item keywords when jumping to an item.  (Fixes #36.  Thanks to [[https://github.com/dfeich][Derek Feichtinger]].)
+  Ensure =grep= supports =--perl-regexp=.
+  Warn when unable to find a suitable scanner (i.e. =rg=, or a PCRE-compatible version of =git= or =grep=).

*** 1.0.1

*Fixes*
+  Test whether =git grep= supports =--perl-regexp= by checking its =--help= output, rather than doing a search and checking for an error.
+  ~message~ instead of ~error~ for weird behavior.  (This message exists to help track down an inconsequential bug.)
+  Remove unused ~magit-todos-ignore-directories~ option.  (To be replaced in a future release.)

*** 1.0.0

Initial release.

** Credits

+  This package was inspired by [[https://github.com/danielma/magit-org-todos.el][magit-org-todos]].
+  The =ag= support was made much simpler by the great [[https://github.com/joddie/pcre2el][pcre2el]] package by Jon Oddie.
+  Thanks to [[https://github.com/zhaojiangbin][Jiangbin Zhao]] for his extensive testing and feedback.
